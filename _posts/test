## Introduction

In the constant arms race between malware developers and security researchers, endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems have grown increasingly sophisticated. Traditional methods of malware evasion—such as process hollowing, indirect syscalls, and process injection—are becoming less effective as EDR solutions learn to detect even the most subtle behaviors. In this article, we introduce a **novel technique** called the **"Shadow Process Chain"**, which has the potential to **evade most modern EDR systems** by dynamically shifting the malware execution context across multiple processes.

## Background

Current EDR systems monitor for suspicious behavior at various levels, including:

- **Process creation and destruction**
- **Memory injection**
- **API hooking and interception**
- **Behavioral analysis of process trees**

Most evasion techniques today focus on disguising malicious behavior within a single process or relying on indirect system calls to avoid detection. However, these approaches have limitations as EDRs become more adept at detecting anomalies within a process, even when traditional indicators are obscured.

### The Shadow Process Chain

The **Shadow Process Chain** introduces a dynamic evasion mechanism where the malware process:

1. **Constantly spawns decoy processes** that inherit handles, memory segments, and threads from the original process.
2. **Shifts the execution context** (code, threads, or even memory regions) between these decoy processes, ensuring that no single process appears fully malicious for long.
3. **Fragmented payload distribution** across multiple processes, ensuring that no process holds the entire malicious payload at any given time.

This approach forces the EDR to chase benign processes while the actual malicious execution is hidden in transient and shifting processes.

## How the Shadow Process Chain Works

### Step 1: Process Shadowing and Handle Inheritance

The malware begins by spawning a chain of legitimate-looking **decoy processes**. Each of these processes inherits crucial handles, such as memory sections or threads, from the previous process. These decoy processes are designed to look benign and perform normal operations to evade heuristic analysis.


### Step 2: Dynamic Execution Transition

Rather than executing the payload directly in a single process, the malware dynamically transfers its **execution context** (via shared memory or APC injection) between these decoy processes. At any given time, part of the malware is running in one process, while the rest is fragmented across other decoy processes.

This ensures that no one process appears suspicious for long enough to trigger detection.

### Step 3: Process Ownership Handoff

The malware **periodically spawns new decoy processes** and **relinquishes control** of its execution context to them. This can be done by migrating threads from the old process into the new one. This process ensures that the **EDR systems track processes that appear legitimate**, while the real malicious execution moves to newly created processes that have a fresh and clean process tree.

### Step 4: Thread and Memory Fragmentation

The malware fragments its execution context by distributing code, data, and threads across multiple processes and memory regions. These processes periodically swap their threads and memory allocations, further confusing behavioral analysis engines and making it nearly impossible for an EDR to follow the complete execution flow.

### Step 5: Transient Process Recreation

As the EDR tries to track the legitimate-looking processes, the malware **periodically kills and recreates** processes while keeping the malicious payload alive in a fragmented state across memory. This creates a rapidly changing execution environment that makes it extremely hard for EDR systems to correlate events across processes.

## Bypassing Advanced EDR Systems

The **Shadow Process Chain** technique is designed to bypass **many modern EDR detection techniques**, including:

1. **Heuristic and Behavioral Analysis**: Since no single process displays sustained malicious behavior, the EDR cannot build a sufficient behavior profile to flag the activity as suspicious.
2. **Memory Scanning**: By fragmenting the payload across multiple processes and frequently transitioning between them, memory scanning tools struggle to identify the complete payload or establish a clear connection between fragments.
3. **Process Tree Analysis**: Traditional process hollowing or injection leaves behind suspicious traces in the process tree. However, in the **Shadow Process Chain**, the process tree remains filled with **legitimate-looking processes** that don’t reveal any signs of malicious activity.
4. **API Hooking and Indirect Syscalls**: The malware uses a combination of **indirect syscalls** and API obfuscation to further confuse the detection mechanisms, ensuring that even if an EDR hooks certain functions, the actual execution remains hidden.

## Advantages of the Shadow Process Chain

1. **Complete Stealth**: No single process behaves in a consistently malicious manner, making detection through behavior analysis extremely difficult.
2. **Minimal Memory Footprint**: By fragmenting the payload and distributing it across multiple processes, the memory footprint of any single process remains small and innocuous.
3. **Constantly Changing Execution**: EDRs struggle to keep up with the constant recreation and destruction of processes, making it nearly impossible to track the actual execution flow.
4. **Versatile**: This technique can be applied to various payload types, from traditional malware to more sophisticated tools like ransomware or advanced persistent threats (APTs).

## Potential Improvements

While the **Shadow Process Chain** provides a robust framework for evading detection, future research can focus on:

- **Automating Execution Context Migration**: Creating an automated system for continuously shifting the execution context between processes to avoid any manual intervention.
- **Combining with Kernel-Level Evasion**: By combining this technique with kernel-level evasion, the malware can further hide its execution from even advanced EDR solutions that monitor kernel-mode behavior.
- **Adding AI-based Context Shifting**: Use machine learning models to dynamically determine the optimal times to shift processes and threads to avoid detection, based on the behavior of the EDR system.

## Conclusion

The **Shadow Process Chain** is a novel technique that enables malware to evade the majority of modern EDR systems by continuously shifting execution across multiple processes, fragmenting the payload, and creating transient processes that confuse process tracking mechanisms. By making EDRs chase benign decoy processes, this technique introduces a new level of stealth, ensuring that no process displays malicious behavior for long enough to be detected.

With this technique, malware developers can move beyond traditional process hollowing or indirect syscall methods, introducing a more dynamic and resilient method of evading even the most advanced detection technologies.
